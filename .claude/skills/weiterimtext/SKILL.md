  Use mid-session to move cleanly from a just-merged change to the next task — the seam between two
  units of work, and the counterpart to moin (bring-up) and feierabend (wind-down). Confirm the
  change actually landed, tidy the branch state, bring the living documents current, then
  re-validate the next task against current reality and start it ONLY if it is genuinely ready and
  decision-free; otherwise surface the decision and stop. Keeps the session's context; re-verifies
  the external world before writing.

# After merge — the seam between two units of work

*Carries out rules S1, S2, G1 and C4. The
[catalog](https://github.com/nanatsusaya/agent-project-rules/blob/main/method/rules.md)
is the authority; this file is only the procedure.*

Between finishing one unit of work and starting the next there is a seam, and
the seam is where things quietly go wrong: a branch is left dangling, the state
artifact drifts, or the task you had in mind was closed by something that merged
while you were busy.

This runs **mid-session**, so it is deliberately light. You are already
oriented — do not re-brief the project, its history or its standing rules.

## The principle: keep your context, re-verify the world

The context you have accumulated this session — the decisions, the reasoning,
the why — is an **asset. Keep it.** This procedure does not ask you to distrust
it or start from a blank slate.

What changes outside your control is the **shared, external state**: the trunk,
the changes awaiting review, the status and scope of tickets, the files on the
remote. Other people and other sessions move those while you work. So the
discipline is narrow and specific: **before writing to a shared artifact or
committing to the next task, re-fetch and re-check that external state.**

The distinction matters. Losing your own context to be safe costs you everything
you worked out this session and prevents nothing.

**Guardrails (do not violate):**

- **Gated autonomy — the crux.** Steps 1 to 3 run autonomously. Starting the
  next task in step 5 does not. Begin only if the task is genuinely ready and
  decision-free. If it needs a judgment that belongs to the decider, is too
  large to start without agreeing its shape first, or is ambiguous — **stop and
  ask.**
- **Never merge.** This runs *after* a merge someone else performed. Step 1
  verifies that; if it did not happen, this stops.
- **Never write to the trunk.** Every change, including the document sync in
  step 3, goes through review like any other.

## 1. Did the unit actually close?

Do not tidy up work that is not finished. Fetch, then read the current state
rather than assuming it:

- Confirm the change is **actually merged** — not merely opened, approved or
  green.
- If it is not merged, or there is uncommitted work that was not part of it,
  **stop here.** Report the real state and let the decider resolve it. Cleaning
  up on a false premise destroys work.

## 2. Branch hygiene

Sync to the merged state, delete the merged branch locally, prune
remote-tracking branches. End on the trunk with a clean tree.

## 3. Bring the living documents current — after re-checking

The finished change may have altered what is true; a **parallel** change may
have already recorded it. So re-verify before writing:

- Re-read the **current** state artifact on the freshly synced trunk, together
  with recent merges and open changes, to see whether the state is **already**
  reflected. If another session got there first, do not duplicate the change —
  note it and move on.
- Only if genuinely stale, update the state artifact and any other affected
  living document. This is a normal change through review, kept to one concern.
- Add a **method-log** entry only if a genuinely methodological moment occurred:
  a correction and its reasoning, a workflow experiment, a mistake worth not
  repeating. Not routine execution.

## 4. Re-validate the next task against current reality

Take the single clearest next task from the state artifact — but treat the plan
you formed earlier as a **hypothesis**, because the world may have moved:

- **Still the right next step?** Or has something reordered priorities, or is
  there now a defect that jumps the queue?
- **Already done or obsolete?** Re-read the ticket's current state and criteria.
- **Preconditions met?** The things it depends on — are they actually in place?
- **Is a decision open?** If so, that is the gate below.

## 5. Start clean, or stop

- **Ready and decision-free:** cut a fresh branch from the up-to-date trunk and
  begin, carrying your full session context forward and working to the project's
  definition of done.
- **The gate tripped:** do **not** start. Present the specific decision or the
  planning that is needed, recommend a default, and wait. Starting the next task
  is never worth undermining the review boundary.

Either way, report the transition briefly: what closed, what the documents now
say, and either what you started or what needs an answer.
